                <p>I will be graduating from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in June with a specialization in Coastal and Marine Management. My master's group project investigated the economic feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in southern California. Check out our group website <a href ="https://sbmussels.weebly.com/">here</a>. This summer I will be assisting in the annual calculation of the Ocean Health Index global scores.
